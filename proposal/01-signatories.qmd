# Signatories

<!--
This section provides the ISC with a view of the support received from
the community for a proposal. Acceptance isn't predicated on
popularity but community acceptance is important. Willingness to
accept outside input is also a good marker for project delivery.

An optional section would be for R-Core signatories where changes to R
are proposed.

## Project team

<!--
Who are the people responsible for actually delivering the project if
the proposal gets accepted and are already signed up and rearing to
go? Briefly describe all participants and the skills they will bring
to the project.

### Doug Kelkhoff

Long time R advocate with a passion for developer tooling. Doug has been
involved in R Consortium projects since 2018 when Doug joined the R Validation
Hub [@rvh], which he now chairs. Doug represents Genentech, Inc. on the board of
the R Consortium, however this work is of personal interest and is not
affiliated with his involvement in this capacity. Doug has a history of working
on deeply technical projects that interface with the internals of R including
[@typewriter] for runtime type-checking, [@testex] for embedding testable code
alongside documentation, and by implementing an R interpreter [@r-rust]. Most
relevant is his prior work on [@debugadapter].

Doug is committed to making R an accessible language that provides effective
tools regardless of IDE.

TODO:
  - If you plan to blog about this while we're working on it, I think that would
    be a great addition. They value the social aspect of technical work,
    especially if it draws attention to what the R Consortium funds.
