# Success
<!--
Projects should have a definition of done that is measurable, and a
thorough understanding going in of what the risks are to delivery
-->

## Measuring success

<!--
How will we know when success is achieved, what markers can we use
along the way
-->

This work has significant potential that can be meaningfully advanced within three
months, providing a solid foundation for future development.

We would consider this phase of the project successful if we deliver a 
production-ready R package that implements a comprehensive DAP server, along
with the necessary R internal changes to support it. 

## Definition of done

<!--
What does success look like?
-->

Although creating a production-ready DAP implementation is ambitious, the
three month timeline allows for thorough development and testing. We would
consider our work complete after we have:

1. **Delivered enhanced R internal capabilities** - A well-tested patch to R that
   extends browser hooks beyond current `USE_BROWSER_HOOKS` functionality
2. **Implemented a comprehensive DAP server** - An R package that covers all core
   DAP protocol features including breakpoints, stepping, variable inspection,
   and evaluation
3. **Demonstrated cross-IDE compatibility** - Verified functionality across
   multiple IDEs (VSCode, vim/neovim, emacs) with documented setup instructions
4. **Established R Core collaboration** - Clear communication with R Core about
   integration path and received preliminary feedback on our proposed changes

The extended timeline allows us to move beyond proof-of-concept to a solution
that users could realistically adopt, while maintaining the exploratory spirit
that will inform future R language development.

## Future work

<!--
How could this be extended / developed in the future by yourself
and/or the community in general?
-->

With a three-month development cycle, this work provides a strong foundation that
the R community can build upon. The extended timeline allows us to:

**Immediate Impact (Months 1-3):**
- Deliver a working DAP implementation that users can install and use
- Provide clear documentation and integration guides for multiple IDEs
- Establish patterns and practices for R-native IDE integration

**Medium-term Impact (withn 3 months post-completion):**
- Support community adoption and gather user feedback for refinement
- Work with R Core on integration of our proposed language changes
- Facilitate alignment between existing DAP projects (`vscDebugger`, `ark`)

**Long-term Vision:**
- Our implementation becomes the foundation for R's standard debugging interface
- R Core adopts and maintains the enhanced browser hook infrastructure
- The R ecosystem benefits from unified, cross-IDE debugging capabilities

We anticipate that the additional development time will reveal and address
implementation challenges that a shorter timeline would miss, particularly
around breakpoint management in complex R environments and synchronization
between IDE and console debugging interfaces.
