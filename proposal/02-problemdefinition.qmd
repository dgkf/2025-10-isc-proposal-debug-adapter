## The Debug-Adapter Protocol

The debug-adapter protocol [@dap-spec] (DAP) is an open standard, proposed by
Microsoft and popularized through VSCode. As VSCode seems to be the dominant
choice of IDE[^vscode-domination], many languages have provided an
implementation of this protocol as part of a VSCode extension that allows VSCode
to feel like it has native knowledge of that particular language. Because of its
ubiquity, many other IDEs and editors today support the DAP. These include, but
are certainly not limited to, [vim](https://github.com/puremourning/vimspector),
[neovim](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap),
[emacs](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/dap-mode),
[helix](https://helix-editor.com/news/release-22-03-highlights/),
[kakoune](https://github.com/jdugan6240/kak-dap), and [Eclipse
IDE](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.lsp4e).

R's debugging story is fairly unique among programming languages because of the
incredible interactivity that users expects when working in an R prompt. A
stateful global environment, the ability to dynamically affect the debug state
and the interactivity afforded by the built-in debug prompt all make for a
seamless debug experience from the console prompt, but at the cost of foregoing
the visual experience of an IDE. Conversely, IDEs that leverage the DAP often
assume that a static snippet of code is to be run and debugged, building a
debugging experience around non-interactive code. We believe that the comfort
and flexibility of R's command-line prompt can live alongside the DAP, allowing
the DAP to attach to a running R session to use for debugging by hooking into
the existing browser prompt.

## Prior Art, Remaining Gaps

This approach is novel among existing implementations of the DAP, both in
`vscDebugger` [@vscDebugger] and `ark` [@ark], which both come with additional
software requirements and tight coupling to their respective IDEs. `vscDebugger`
is designed to work specifically with VSCode and relies on having a running
JavaScript process which serves to intercept background R process debug prompt
output and parse its content to resolve DAP requests. This mechanism is limited
by what information is exposed in the debugger console output and can not attach
to a running user session, meaning that any persistent state that R users might
expect from their session is lost when debugging. `ark` addresses this problem
by bundling the R kernel with the DAP server. However, this introduces another
challenge because it now requires the IDE to communicate with what is
effectively a new standard for serving both an interactive prompt and DAP
server. This project aims to address both of these challenges by building an
implementation that is R-native and can run within an active R session.

Notable hurdles remaining in these projects include:

* `ark`'s lack of support for breakpoints. [`dap_server.rs#L349-351`](https://github.com/posit-dev/ark/blob/fbbb713de3f4a222c4774cbabd53eaf1fb735c51/crates/ark/src/dap/dap_server.rs#L349-L351)
  
  > <sup> [`README.md`](https://github.com/posit-dev/ark/blob/main/README.md) </sup>  
  > Note: Support for breakpoints is currently missing but you can use `debug()`,
  > `debugonce()`, or `browser()` to drop into the debugger.

* `vscDebugger` recognizes that current limitations with the `browser()` prompt
  are a bottleneck to providing a pure R solution. [`vscDebugger #33`](https://github.com/ManuelHentschel/vscDebugger/issues/33#issuecomment-638733787)
  
* `vscDebugger`'s implementation of attach mode (the DAPs mode of interacting
  with an existing interactive session) requires special care to manage debug
  state. [`vscDebugger #193`](https://github.com/ManuelHentschel/VSCode-R-Debugger/issues/193#issuecomment-2735871666)

This work is not intended to fully replace these projects, but rather to provide
an alternative that prioritizes IDE agnosticism and works with the R Core to
address any hurdles which prevent a complete DAP implementation. While
convergence of approaches would be ideal, this work would be considered
successful if it consolidated open implementation questions through a central
channel.

## Possible R Core Changes

Although this project isn't predicated on changes to the R language itself, it
is very possible that this work may inform future features for R's browser
prompt, hooks and tracing functionality. Notably, R should be able to:

1. Run code upon pausing and providing a browser prompt to the user. We intend
   to execute code, opaque to the user, the sends information about the current
   frame back to the IDE.
2. Run code upon resuming execution. This will be used to signal that the IDE
   should visually convey that code is currently executing.
3. Set breakpoints in R functions in a way that does not interfere with the way
   that expression-level or line-level breakpoint placement is synchronized with
   the IDE.
4. Provide a mechanism of stepping into R code without a source file.

We hope to explore all of these capabilities, implement the best possible
solution given R's current state and if necessary, propose changes that might
make them more actionable in the future.

For development, we plan to use a version of R which enables the
`USE_BROWSER_HOOK` flag. Seeing as this feature has been gated by a compilation
flag, we plan to provide feedback about how this feature enables the
implementation of a more integrated debugging experience.
